	//LinkedList class belongs to List interface
	// Each element in the LinkedList is called the Node. 
	//Each Node of the LinkedList contains two items: 
		//1) Content of the element 
		//2) Pointer/Address/Reference to the Next Node in the LinkedList.
		//1. Head of the LinkedList only contains the Address of the First element of the List.
		//2. The Last element of the LinkedList contains null in the pointer part of the node
		
	//Linked list allows dynamic memory allocation, which means memory allocation is done at the run time by the compiler 
	//Insert and delete operations in the Linked list are not performance wise expensive 
	//because adding and deleting an element from the linked list does’t require element shifting, 
	//only the pointer of the previous and the next node requires change.
