	Arraylist class implements List interface 

	ArrayList is a resizable-array  

	It implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including null.

	Maintain the elements insertion order

	Allows duplicates

	Why ArrayList is better than Array?

	Arrays has a fixed length(so if it is full you cannot add any more elements to it)

	In Arrays if elements are removed from it the memory consumption would be the same as it doesn’t shrink.

	ArrayList can dynamically grow and shrink after addition and removal of elements 

	ArrayList class enables us to use predefined methods of it which makes our task easy.

	/*
	Methods of ArrayList class

	1) add( Object o): This method adds an object o to the arraylist.
	obj.add("hello");
	This statement would add a string hello in the arraylist at last position.

	2) add(int index, Object o): It adds the object o to the array list at the given index.
	obj.add(2, "bye");
	It will add the string bye to the 2nd index (3rd position as the array list starts with index 0) of array list.

	3) remove(Object o): Removes the object o from the ArrayList.
	obj.remove("Chaitanya");
	This statement will remove the string “Chaitanya” from the ArrayList.

	4) remove(int index): Removes element from a given index.
	obj.remove(3);
	It would remove the element of index 3 (4th element of the list – List starts with o).

	5) set(int index, Object o): Used for updating an element. It replaces the element present at the specified index with the object o.
	obj.set(2, "Tom");
	It would replace the 3rd element (index =2 is 3rd element) with the value Tom.

	6) int indexOf(Object o): Gives the index of the object o. If the element is not found in the list then this method returns the value -1.
	int pos = obj.indexOf("Tom");
	This would give the index (position) of the string Tom in the list.

	7) Object get(int index): It returns the object of list which is present at the specified index.
	String str= obj.get(2);
	Function get would return the string stored at 3rd position (index 2) and would be assigned to the string “str”. We have stored the returned value in string variable because in our example we have defined the ArrayList is of String type. If you are having integer array list then the returned value should be stored in an integer variable.

	8) int size(): It gives the size of the ArrayList – Number of elements of the list.
	int numberofitems = obj.size();

	9) boolean contains(Object o): It checks whether the given object o is present in the array list if its there then it returns true else it returns false.
	obj.contains("Steve");
	It would return true if the string “Steve” is present in the list else we would get false.

	10) clear(): It is used for removing all the elements of the array list in one go. The below code will remove all the elements of ArrayList whose object is obj.
	obj.clear();




	//Adding ArrayList2 into ArrayList1
        list1.addAll(list2);
