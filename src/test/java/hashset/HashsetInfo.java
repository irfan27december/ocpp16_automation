	A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. 
	There are three main implementations of Set interface: HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet. HashSet, which stores its elements in a hash table
	This class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table (actually a HashMap instance). 
	HashSet doesn’t maintain any order, the elements would be returned in any random order.
	HashSet doesn’t allow duplicates. If you try to add a duplicate element in HashSet, the old value would be overwritten.
	HashSet allows null values however if you insert more than one nulls it would still return only one null value.
	HashSet is non-synchronized.
